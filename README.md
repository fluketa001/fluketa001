- 👋 Hi, I’m fluke, I'm Thai and I speak little English.

- 👀 I am now interested in the development of the Golang. 
I'm pretty new to it. But it's an interesting language. But strangely, I should have written the nodeJS as well. 
Because it is a popular language and has a large library which is suitable for many projects.
